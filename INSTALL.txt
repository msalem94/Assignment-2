To build, rebuild, or clean an entire solution
 =============================================

In Solution Explorer, choose or open the solution.

On the menu bar, choose Build, and then choose one of the following commands:

	Choose Build or Build Solution to compile only those project 	files and components that have changed since the most recent 	build.

	Choose Rebuild Solution to "clean" the solution and then 	build all project files and components.

	Choose Clean Solution to delete any intermediate and output 	files. With only the project and component files left, new 	instances of the intermediate and output files can then be 	built. 

To build or rebuild a single project
====================================
	In Solution Explorer, choose or open the project.

	On the menu bar, choose Build, and then choose 	either Build ProjectName or Rebuild ProjectName.

	Choose Build ProjectName to build only those project 	components that have changed since the most recent build.

	Choose Rebuild ProjectName to "clean" the project and then 	build the project files and all project components.

To build only the startup project and its dependencies
======================================================
	On the menu bar, choose Tools, Options.
	
	In the Options dialog box, expand the Projects and 	Solutions node, and then choose the Build and Run page.

	The Build and Run, Projects and Solutions, Options dialog 	box opens.
	
	Select the Only build startup projects and dependencies on 	Run check box.
	
	When this check box is selected, only the current startup 	project and its dependencies are built when you perform 	either of the following steps:
		
		On the menu bar, choose Debug, Start (F5).
		
		On the menu bar, choose Build, Build 				  		Solution (CTRL+SHIFT+B).
		
		When this check box is cleared, all projects, their 			dependencies, and the solution files are built when 			you run either of the preceding commands. By default, 			this check box is cleared.

To build only the selected Visual C++ project
=============================================
Choose a Visual C++ project, and then, on the menu bar, choose Build, Project Only, and one of the following 	commands:
		
		Build Only ProjectName
		
		Rebuild Only ProjectName
		
		Clean Only ProjectName

		Link Only ProjectName

These commands apply only to the Visual C++ project that you chose, without building, rebuilding, cleaning, or linking any project dependencies or solution files. Depending on your version of Visual Studio, the Project Only submenu might contain more commands.

To compile multiple C++ project items
=====================================
In Solution Explorer, choose multiple files that have can be compiled actions, open the shortcut menu for one of those files, and then chooseCompile.
If the files have dependencies, the files will be compiled in dependency order. The compile operation will fail if the files require a precompiled header that isn’t available when you compile. The compile operation uses the current active solution configuration.

To stop a build
===============
Perform either of the following steps:
On the menu bar, choose Build, Cancel.
Choose the Ctrl + Break keys.
